Test Intro:
For this test you need to create a project in django. In this sub module we need to store our
Mobile phone models in an efficient way. We can later select/search these mobile models.
We attached a demo dataset for reference.
Mobile Model Fields:
1.Brand Name
2. Model
3. Color
4. JAN Code (Unique model specific code)
5. Image (Optional)
Create a model for storing unique Mobile phones. Same model can’t be stored.
● Create a form/UI for creating new mobile objects.

1. All necessary validation
2. Check duplicate/ warning for existing data
● Ajax search the mobile phones via model and Jan code
● Select and add/remove the mobile phones in a list.
● You should use SQLite for database.

For frontend using django template view is acceptable. Also you can use any front end
framework and connect via Rest API.
